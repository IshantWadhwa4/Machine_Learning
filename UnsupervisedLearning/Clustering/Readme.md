#Clustering :
             It is an unsupervised learning technique.             
             Cluster is the collection of data objects which are similar to one another within the same group (class or category) 
             and are different from the objects in the other clusters.             
             It can also work as a standalone tool to get the insights about the data distribution or as apreprocessing step in 
             other algorithms.             
             Clustering allows us to find hidden relationship between the data points in the dataset
             
  How do we define good Clustering algorithms?
              High quality clusters can be created by reducing the distance between the objects in the same cluster knownas 
              intra-cluster minimization and increasing the distance with the objects in the other cluster known as 
              inter-cluster maximization.              
              Intra-cluster minimization: The closer the objects in a cluster, the more likely they belong to the samecluster.
              Inter-cluster minimization: This makes the separation between two clusters. The main goal is to maximizethe distance between 
              2 clusters.
              
 There are lot of clustering algorithms and they all use different techniques to cluster.
 They can be classified into two categories as:
 1. Flat or partitioning algorithms
 2. Hierarchical algorithms
