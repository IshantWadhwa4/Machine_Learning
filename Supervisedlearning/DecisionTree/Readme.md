It is like filtering, in the decision tree we create a tree and based on that we take decisions.

It is used for supervise learning for both regesion and classification.

  1. ID3 (for selecting root node) : 
                                    Entropy and Inforamtion gain is calculated. High entropy leads to Hetrogencity, and select the 
                                    column for root node.(High Inforamtion gain select for root node)
  
  2. Gini Index(It work with 2 classes in target variable): 
                                      It also help in calculating the root node. low gini index selected for root node.
                                      High gini index means high entropy.
