Collection of __classification__ algorithms based on __Bayes Theorem__.
Classifies given different __instances (object/data)__ into __predefined classes(groups)__, assuming there is no interdependency of 
features __(class conditional independence)__.

Just before exploring NB in details, letâ€™s understand __few basic concepts__ first:
1. Conditional Probability
2. Bayes Rule
