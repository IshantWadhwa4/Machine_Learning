LinReg:
        This algo will help in supervised learning models. we use this algo for regression problems.
        
Problem statment:
        Sales (in thousands of units) for a particular product as a function of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) 
        for TV, radio, and newspaper media. Suppose that in our role as Data Scientist we are asked to suggest.
        
Important points to remember in linear regression alog:
       
       1. Supervised learning algo for regration problems.
       2. This algo work on continous data only.
       3. y = mx + c
                m is slope/co-officent
                c is intersept/bias
       4. For ideal Linear regration there must be co-relation between dependent and independent variables and no relation between                       
          independent variables.
       5. In reg the prediction is not in the percentage it is the mean differnce between the points.
       6. In feature selection we can select highly co-related columns or features.
       7. we can convert catogorical data to continous data by get_dummy[One hot encoding]
